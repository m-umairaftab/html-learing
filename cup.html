        <h1>Cup Outline</h1>
    <p>In the modern world everybody is busy. Men and women go to their respective places of
work and children have to attend school or college. In such a state of affairs, it should not
be binding on the mother to prepare meals or tea for everybody every time.
Sometimes, she may not be having enough time and at another time, she may be too tired to do
any work. Then, anybody who needs a cup of tea must help himself or herself. Such a situation
arose yesterday in our house. Mother had just returned from office. She was dead tired. I had
come earlier from, school because the school was off for the purpose of making preparations
for a school function which was to be held today.
I took it not only a challenge to prepare a cup of tea for the first time in my life but also
to serve one to my mother as a sudden surprise from me. I stealthily went to the kitchen. I 
lighted the gas oven with the lighter and put the kettle on after putting one cup and a half 
of water in it. As the water started boiling, I put a spoonful of dry tea leaves in it and 
also two small spoons of sugar.</p>
