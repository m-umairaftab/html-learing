    <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p class="courses">
        The artificial intelligence program of the PIAICtakes the student through the foundation 
        of the AI, technology, via technology programming in open source languages like python, 
        numpy, pandas, Tensorflow 2.0 and flask, and teaching deploying practical AI solutions, 
        and use cases , and ending with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice.
    </p>
    <h2>Cloud Native Computing</h2>
    <p class="courses">
        The Cloud Native Computing program prepares the students to program in open technologies like 
        Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React, and React Native while introducing students
        to development of microservices and software development techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.
    </p>
    <h2>Block Chain</h2>
    <p class="courses">
        The main emphasis of Blockchain program is to understand the blockchains like Ethereum 
        and hyperledger(fabric) and learn to program in languages such as solidity, JavaScript
